How to set up JANUS
===================

JANUS is a module for simpleSAMLphp. 

To set up JANUS you need to do the following:

  * Set up a working copy of simpleSAMLphp >= 1.7.0
  * Set up an authentication source
  * Download JANUS
  * Set up database
  * Configure JANUS

For instructions on how to set up a working copy of simpleSAMLphp and how to
set up a authentication source, please refer to http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/

Then you should get the desired version of JANUS and install it as a module for
your simpleSAMLphp installation and copy the configuration file template to the
simpleSAMLphp configuration directory.

Next set up a working database and run the SQL snippet that shippes with JANUS
located in the docs directory. You should change the storageengine and 
characterset to fit your needs. You can use another pefix for the table names 
by editing the `prefix` option in the configuration file.

Set the parameter 'useridattr' to match the attribute you want
to make the connection between the user and the entities.

Now you should have a working installation of JANUS. For a more detailed
